# elm-for-web-developers

Kickstart your web development with Elm. 

A collection of notes for web developers looking into moving to Elm.

# Interaction, purity and signals

Elm's signals make it easy to mark a function as pure. 

```
clockTypeSelectView : Signal.Address Update -> Clock -> Html.Html
```

denotes when a function does something impure - the fact that it takes a signal means there is probably some level of reactivity in the function. 

```
quarterlyView : Clock -> Html.Html
```

the lack of signal lets the developer know that that function involves no interaction, but may change based on changes within the `Clock` model.

# Stylesheets

## Linking

In order to use stylesheets in Elm, you must create a [custom index.html(https://github.com/eeue56/broken-clock/blob/master/index.html) page. In there, you can link in any stylesheets you want. 

E.G:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

You must include "elm.js" in there - this is created when you run elm-make, and contains your elm application and the elm runtime. 

In your terminal:
```
elm-make <main-filename>
```

In index.html: 

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="elm.js"></script>
```

You must also then bootstrap your Elm application by putting in a call to Elm.fullscreen:

```
<script type="text/javascript">
  Elm.fullscreen(Elm.ModuleName);
</script>
```

A full working example can be found [here](https://github.com/eeue56/broken-clock/blob/master/index.html). You could also do this by using a build tool to insert the stylesheets into the html generated by elm-make after they're created, but this way you don't need to worry about that. 

## Using classes in Elm

Giving HTML elements in Elm is as easy as

```
div [ class "clock-time" ] []
```

with the CSS

```
.clock-time {
    color : red;
}

```

# Optimization

While Elm is fast [at some things](http://elm-lang.org/blog/blazing-fast-html), it's easy to write non-performant code in Elm if you stick too rigidly to the functional programming style.

## Move things out of let bindings

If a function can be defined outside of a let binding, then take it out. 

TODO: add example

## Flat is better than nested

The less levels of functions involved, the better. If you find yourself nesting function calls within function calls over and over, look and see if you can simplify.

# FAQ

## Why does start-app give me an unexpected type error?

If you get an error like this 
```
  -- TYPE MISMATCH ----------------------------------------------------- index.elm
  
  The 1st argument to function `start` has an unexpected type.
  
  14|   StartApp.start { model = model, view = view, update = update }
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  As I infer the type of values flowing through your program, I see a conflict
  between these two types:

    Int

    String

```

this probably means that somewhere in your view or update methods, there is a type error. In order to get a more useful error message, add type signatiures to your functions, which will force it to check the types as you expect them to be.
